This directory countains copies of the third-party modules

https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py

and

https://github.com/joshthecoder/tweepy

This is mainly to avoid module-version-dependency hell, but
also proved useful when I found some annoying bugs in the
Tweepy module. The local fixes here have been submitted upstream
to the module maintainer, but I won't link to my fork on github
because that would totally ruin my anonymity. (So don't look
at the pull requests there if you don't want to know who I am!)
