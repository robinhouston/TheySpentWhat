# Just about the simplest possible implementation of the twitter-search
# client specified in README.txt.

# This is not production-ready, because it does not deal elegantly with
# disconnections or other varieties of failure. A reliable service ought,
# at the very least, to check on startup for tweets that were addressed to
# us since the last time we ran. As things stand, any tweets addressed to us
# while we were not running will go unanswered forever.
