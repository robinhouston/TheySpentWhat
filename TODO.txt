Missing features:
 - intelligent truncation of response if it would be longer than 140 characters
 
 - ability to specify councils by location rather than name, specifically by:
   o postcode
   o partial postcode
   o geotagged tweets

 - allow council names (at least) to be specified in abbreviated form,
   e.g. Cambs rather than Cambridgeshire.
 
 - make the tweet format more flexible, so that queries with an obvious meaning
   can be understood even if they're not "properly" formatted. (This would
   benefit from seeing how real users try to interact with it.)
 
 - dialogues with the asker, to resolve serious ambiguity, e.g.
  
   @theyspentwhat in Cambridgeshire during 2010
   @asker Do you mean 1) Cambridgeshire County Council, 2) East Cambridgeshire
          or 3) South Cambridgeshire?
   @theyspentwhat 1 (OR: @theyspentwhat county -- anything that unambiguously answers it)
   
   (The "most interesting" heuristic feels rather arbitrary in such cases.)

Other things that need doing:
 - User-facing documentation (at least a web page)
 - Get a better feeling for the limitations of the data.
   For example there are some entries with negative values: how should they be
   treated? But there must be many other limitations. The inconsistent date ranges
   of available data make the whole lot trickier to interpret in aggregate, too.
 - Thorough testing of all the edge cases, etc.
 - Trial with real users

Nice to have:
 - if it proved popular, a website showing common queries, recent queries

 - some way to facilitate dialogue among Twitter users about the data
   (a bit vague, this one, but only because there are so many ways one
   could do it)
