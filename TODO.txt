Missing features:
 - ability to specify councils by location rather than name, specifically by:
   o postcode
   o partial postcode
   o geotagged tweets

 - dialogues with the asker, to resolve serious ambiguity, e.g.
  
   @theyspentwhat in Cambridgeshire during 2010
   @asker Do you mean 1) Cambridgeshire County Council, 2) East Cambridgeshire
          or 3) South Cambridgeshire?
   @theyspentwhat 1 (OR: @theyspentwhat county -- anything that unambiguously answers it)

Other things that need doing:
 - user-facing documentation (at least a web page)
 - thorough testing
 - trial with real users

Nice to have:
 - if it proved popular, a website showing common queries, recent queries

 - some way to facilitate dialogue among Twitter users about the data
   (a bit vague, this one, but only because there are so many ways one
   could do it)
