Prerequisites:

- Python 2.6
    [Should also work with 2.7, and could be made to work with earlier
     versions by installing the simplejson module and changing all
     occurences of "import json" to "import simplejson as json" in the
     Python code. If Python is installed somewhere other than /usr/bin
     then you'll need to edit the shebang lines.]

- Redis 2.2.1
    [Almost certainly works with other versions too. This is just the
     version it has been tested with.]

- Download and unzip http://openlylocal.com/councils/spending.csv.zip


Instructions:

Start the Redis server (redis-server)
Load the data (bin/import-data spending.csv)
Start the server (bin/run)
